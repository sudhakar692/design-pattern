# Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Ninja has to design a 2 players game Tic-Tac-Toe played on an ‘N’ * ‘N’ grid.
Ninja has to assume the following rules while playing the game:

`This game is played between two people (Player 1 and Player 2). Player 1 chooses 'X' and Player 2 chooses 'O' to mark their cells. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.

A player who successfully places 'N' of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.`
